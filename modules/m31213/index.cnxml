        <item>This module continues the work dealt with in grade 5. Addition and subtraction of fractions are extended and calculation of a fraction of a particular amount is revised.</item>
        <item>Check whether the learners know the correct terminology and are able to use the correct strategies for doing the above correctly. </item>
        <item>Critical outcome 5 (Communicating effectively by using visual, symbolic and /or language skills in a variety of ways) is addressed. </item>
        <item>It should be possible to work through the module in 3 weeks.</item>
        <item>** Activity 17 is designed as a portfolio task. It is a very simple task, but learners should do it neatly and accurately. They must be informed in advance of how the educator will be assessing the work.</item>

        <item>LEARNING UNIT 2 FOCUSES ON DECIMAL FRACTIONS</item>
        <item>This module extends the work that was done in grade 5. Learners should be able to do rounding of decimal fractions to the nearest tenth, hundredth and thousandth. Emphasise the use of the correct method (vertical) for addition and subtraction. Also spend sufficient time on the multiplication and division of decimal fractions.</item>
        <item>As learners usually have difficulty with the latter, you could allow 3 to 4 weeks for this section of the work.</item>

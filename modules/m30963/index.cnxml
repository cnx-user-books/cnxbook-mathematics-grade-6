        <item>This module continues the work dealt with in grade 5. Addition and subtraction of fractions are extended and calculation of a fraction of a particular amount is revised.</item>
        <item>Check whether the learners know the correct terminology and are able to use the correct strategies for doing the above correctly. </item>
        <item>Critical outcome 5 (Communicating effectively by using visual, symbolic and /or language skills in a variety of ways) is addressed. </item>
        <item>It should be possible to work through the module in 3 weeks.</item>
        <item>** Activity 17 is designed as a portfolio task. It is a very simple task, but learners should do it neatly and accurately. They must be informed in advance of how the educator will be assessing the work.</item>

        <item>LEARNING UNIT 2 FOCUSES ON DECIMAL FRACTIONS</item>
        <item>This module extends the work that was done in grade 5. Learners should be able to do rounding of decimal fractions to the nearest tenth, hundredth and thousandth. Emphasise the use of the correct method (vertical) for addition and subtraction. Also spend sufficient time on the multiplication and division of decimal fractions.</item>
        <item>As learners usually have difficulty with the latter, you could allow 3 to 4 weeks for this section of the work.</item>
        <item>** Activity 19 is a task for the portfolio. The assignment is fairly simple, but learners should complete it neatly and accurately. They must be informed in advance of how the educator will be assessing the work.</item>

        <para id="id4512963">You have to work in groups of three for this activity. Ask your educator for the paper that you will need. Read the questions attentively and show the operations that you use for calculating the answers:</para>

        <para id="id1166972074738">3. The Grade 6 learners have been asked to establish a vegetable garden at the school. If they plant half of the garden with carrots, two sixths with potatoes and one twelfth with spinach, what fraction of the whole garden has been planted?</para>
        <para id="id9023109">4. Because they have worked so hard in the garden, the classes are rewarded. The 6A class drinks four and one fifth litres of cold drink; the 6B class drinks five and four tenths litres of cold drink and the 6C class drinks three and two thirds litres. How many litres of cold drink did the school provide for the learners?</para>
